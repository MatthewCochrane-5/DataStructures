# DataStructures
Matthew Cochrane
This is my submission for Module Eight Journal in CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

- The problem that I was solving was how to read a csv file into various data structures, namely a vector, a tree, and a hash table.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

- The main approach I took for each data structure was to get each course into its own Course object and then orient those in the data structures appropriately. This allowed for simple extraction as all of an individual course's information is contained within each Course object.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

- Besides staring at the screen for longer than is healthy, I tended to lean on forums like stackoverflow which contained similar types of problems that other users had kindly given their solutions for.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

- Before this course, I always thought advanced data structures such as linked lists and hash tables were unneccesarily complicated compared to a standard array or vector. However, after analyzing the run-times of each type I found that they are extremely powerful especially when concerning large batches of data. I will remember hash tables the next time I need to implement a data structure.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

For all future code, I will have more useful and efficient comments as well as making sure that my main function is clear of logic that would more appropriately be used in its own function.
